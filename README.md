# Heat Load Calc

This simulation tool is used to calculate heating and cooling loads and room temperatures for buildings and homes.

The main features of this simulation tool are as follows

- Room temperature can be controlled by set temperature, set operating temperature, and set PMV. The set operating temperature control can take into account the effect of indoor surface temperature, and the set PMV control can also take into account the effect of occupant's MET value, clo value, and indoor humidity.
